Sam Cassell scored 23 points as the Milwaukee Bucks extended their 
winning streak to a season-high six games with a 105-98 victory over 
the Charlotte Hornets on Friday night. The Bucks, winners of 16 of 
their last 20 games, stretched their Central Division lead over Charlotte 
to 2 1/2 games. The Hornets have lost four straight and 10 of their 
last 13. Jason Caffey scored nine of his 16 points in the decisive 
fourth quarter, and combined with Cassell to score all 11 points in 
an 11-4 run that sealed the game for the Bucks. Milwaukee led 85-81 
with just over eight minutes to play when Cassell and Caffey took 
over. Cassell started the run with two free throws. Caffey was then 
called for goaltending a shot by David Wesley shot, but redeemed himself 
by scoring on a driving dunk that drew a foul. He made the free throw, 
and after a miss by Jamal Mashburn, Cassell scored on a jumper to 
put the Bucks up 93-83. Charlotte was without center Elden Campbell 
and reserve forward Derrick Coleman. Campbell was out with the flu, 
forcing the Hornets to start Otis Thorpe in his place. And without 
Coleman, who sat out with a bruised left knee, Charlotte had few big 
bodies to send in to relieve Thorpe and P.J. Brown. That left the 
Hornets struggling on defense and with little or no low-post presence. 
Brown was often the only defender under the Milwaukee basket, which 
allowed the Bucks clear drives through the lane as they built a 59-47 
halftime lead _ the most points the Hornets have allowed in a half 
this season. Charlotte came out with much more intensity in the third 
quarter and used good shot selection and aggressive work on the boards 
to mount a 9-0 run that pulled them to 67-66. The Hornets then took 
their first lead of the game on Brown's layup that made it 73-71 with 
1:55 to play in the third. But they grew tired in the fourth quarter 
and never could answer the Bucks' offense, which shot 52 percent for 
the game. Mashburn had a triple-double for Charlotte with 26 points, 
10 rebounds and 10 assists, but continuted his feast-early, famine-late 
routine by scoring 17 in the first quarter. Wesley added 23. Glenn 
Robinson scored 20 for the Bucks. Notes: Ray Allen had his streak 
of scoring 20 or more points against the Hornets snapped at seven 
games. He finished with 11. Wesley and Baron Davis combined to shoot 
13-of-31... The Hornets had Christian music group 4Him perform a free 
concert after the game in a move to attract a larger crowd. The incentive 
helped entice fans, 16,436 showed up _ an increase from the Hornets' 
average of 14,311.

Troy Bell, Kenny Harley and Ryan Sidney each scored 16 points as No. 
25 Boston College defeated Rutgers 77-51 Saturday. The Eagles (13-2, 
4-1 Big East) are off to their best start since going 22-9 in 1996-97, 
the last time they made the NCAA tournament. Rutgers (8-9, 0-6), a 
single-digit loser in all of its league games before Saturday, was 
led by Todd Billet's 22 points. Holding a 33-32 lead early in the 
second half, Boston College, which struggled from the field for most 
of the game, broke loose for a 14-3 run over a 4:09 stretch. Xavier 
Singletary, who added 12 points, made a pair of 3-pointers and Bell 
had two baskets during the key burst. The Scarlet Knights, the Big 
East's second-worst free throwing shooting team at .595 percent entering 
the game, hurt themselves at the line during the Eagles' decisive 
run. They hit only one of five attempts. Rutgers never closed within 
double digits the rest of the way as BC gradually built its lead. 
The Eagles shot 43.3 percent for the game (29-for-67), but was below 
40 percent for most of the game until some late baskets. The Eagles, 
who lost 97-75 at No. 2 Duke Tuesday, started slowly and hit just 
one of their first 10 shots. Boston College improved and went on to 
lead 29-25 at halftime. Rutgers' last road win over a ranked opponent 
came over three years ago, 72-63 at Temple Dec. 20, 1997.

thanks for looking in. here's the top story -- all the bodies of the 
17 crew members killed in the attack on the "uss cole" have been recovered 
as congress joins in the investigation into the blast. eight of the 
bodies should arrive tomorrow at dover air force base in delaware. 
pentagon officials say the last four sets of remains were recovered 
today and will follow in a second plane. the victims were found over 
the last three days by search teams cutting through the damaged interior 
of the ship. the first five bodies recovered were flown home last 
weekend. investigators in yemen say they're making progress in the 
hunt for whoever was behind the attack on the "cole." walter rodgers 
updates the developments in the case. forensic efforts paddle a rubber 
dinghy through the blast hole and float inside the crippled destroyer 
"uss cole." officials say the investigation is making good progress, 
though it will take time to develop significant evidence to say who 
launched the attack on the u.s. warship. those on board say the scene 
inside is nothing short of catastrophic. the american fbi directer 
louis freeh described the blast scene. moved decks literally around. 
so it is a tangled mass of metal and wire. yemeni officials and the 
fbi director say there's been considerable progress in developing 
evidence. a senior u.s. official confirmed several locations have 
been found where the bombers operated from and they say several people 
were involved. yemen's president is pointing a finger in the direction 
of afghanistan. they are elements from al-jihad returning from afghanistan. 
president saleh says he thinks they are part of a group returning 
from afghanistan and he said yemen has identified a number of eyewitnesss. 
the americans have used the name osama bin laden. do you believe he's 
involved? "maybe," he replayed. it is much too early in the case to 
come to that conclusion. we have some theories as you almost have 
to have when you begin an investigation of this kind. off the coast 
of yemen, a marine carrier stands by, providing support and protection 
during the salvage operation. the attack on the destroyer testifies 
to afundamental change in the nature of terrorism. officials here 
say perpetrators are far less likely to claim responsibility. rather, 
they say, the motivation of the case may simply have been to kill 
large numbers of americans. walter rodgers, cnn, aden, yemen. u.s. 
senators are asking why the "cole" was being refueled at the port 
in yemen in the first place. retired general anthony zinni added yemen 
to the list of refueling spots when he served as the u.s. regional 
commander for the middle east. he told the senate armed services committee 
today it was a strategic decision. he says it had nothing to do with 
improving relations with yemen.
